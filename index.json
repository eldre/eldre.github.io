Many human activities (e.g. fisheries, ore transformation) occur in the bay, which can affect natural ecosystems and potentially modify services they provide. As coastal ecosystems rank among the most vulnerable ecosystems, benthic communities are an ideal marker of ecosystem status. Here, we aim at integrating information on both benthic communities and potential drivers of impacts to monitor the ecosystem status and to identify management actions. We present the results of a multi-approach study that a) characterized different ecological components in the bay, b) assessed the overall environmental status and c) detected effects of multiple drivers on benthic species. With this study, we provide an integrative framework to monitor the status of coastal benthic ecosystems and pave the way to inform managers on actionable policies in industrial harbour areas.

Local assessments facilitate dialogue between multiple users of the ecosystem (industries, individuals) and allow a better understanding of ecosystem components variability (e.g. benthic species, habitats) in a given region. Our objective was to evaluate the local effects (~0.01 km2 resolution) of the cumulative exposure of anthropogenic drivers on benthic species composition and diversity. Our study was conducted in the Sept-Îles region in Québec, where numerous human activities vary in local intensity (e.g. international shipping, fisheries or domestic and industrial wastes). Macro-infaunal diversity and abiotic parameters of the sediments were characterized in situ, and cumulative exposure scores were computed for each activity as a function of distance from the source, intensity and physical constraints (e.g. bathymetry). Community composition and diversity were then modelled as a function of abiotic parameters and cumulative exposure scores using Hierarchical Bayesian modelling (HMSC). We will use outcomes of these models to predict community compositions under different scenarios of human activity exposure in the bay, and to support the development of indicators of environmental status considering multiple anthropogenic drivers.","tags":["Sept-Îles","Benthos","Anthropogenic drivers","Prediction"],"title":"How to characterize human influence on coastal benthic ecosystems?","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This website and its included content belong to Elliot Dreujou.

Local assessments facilitate dialogue between multiple users of the ecosystem (industries, individuals) and allow to better understand variation among benthic communities in a given region. In this project, we aim to develop indicators of cumulative impacts to assess the environmental health of benthic ecosystems within industrialized regions in the Gulf of St. Lawrence at a small spatial scale (0,01 km2). We selected coastal regions around Sept-Îles, where numerous human activities are present at different intensities (such as international shipping, fisheries or domestic and industrial wastes). Subtidal ecosystems were sampled in 2016-2017 to characterize macro-endobenthic diversity and abiotic parameters of the sediment. We calculated impact scores for each human activity based on the distance from the source and the magnitude of its impact. We thus identified hotspots of cumulative impact and changes in the biotic and abiotic compartments along impact gradients. These results will be used for the development of indicators of cumulative stress and to understand resilience and stability of bay-scale benthic communities.","tags":["Sept-Îles","Benthos","Anthropogenic drivers","Characterization"],"title":"Benthic communities and human activities: a peaceful cohabitation?","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Elliot Dreujou","Philippe Archambault","Christopher W McKindsey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1510531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563909533,"objectID":"c144be3c1c3d899867a87c24c8826f65","permalink":"https://eldre.github.io/talk/talk_2_qo/","publishdate":"2017-11-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/talk_2_qo/","section":"talk","summary":"Presentation of results gathered during the 2017 campaign at Sept-Îles.","tags":["Sept-Îles","Benthos","Anthropogenic drivers","Characterization"],"title":"Benthic communities and human activities: a peaceful cohabitation?","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Elliot Dreujou","Philippe Archambault","Christopher W McKindsey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1493596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563909533,"objectID":"5d0f50f2a942b8ba4682f995fd648a9d","permalink":"https://eldre.github.io/talk/poster_4_chone/","publishdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/poster_4_chone/","section":"talk","summary":"Poster presented during the 2nd general assembly of researchers from Canadian Healthy Oceans Network (CHONe II).
